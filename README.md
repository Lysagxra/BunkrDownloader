# Bunkr Downloader - GUI Edition

This project is a fork of the original [BunkrDownloader by Lysagxra](https://github.com/Lysagxra/BunkrDownloader). Huge thanks to her for creating and maintaining the powerful core of this application!

This version focuses on providing a user-friendly **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for Windows users and includes other features to make downloading from Bunkr as simple as possible.

python3 downloader.py <bunkr_url>
```

### Selective & Batch Downloads

All the original flags like `--ignore`, `--include`, and batch downloading via `URLs.txt` are still supported. For more details, please refer to the [original README](https://github.com/Lysagxra/BunkrDownloader/blob/main/README.md).

## Logging

The application logs any issues encountered during the download process in a file named `session_log.txt`. Check this file for any URLs that may have been blocked or had errors.
