# Bunkr Downloader Portable GUI

This project is a fork of the original [BunkrDownloader by Lysagxra](https://github.com/Lysagxra/BunkrDownloader). Huge thanks to her for creating and maintaining the powerful core of this application!

This version focuses on providing an user-friendly **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for Windows users and includes other features to make downloading as simple as possible.
